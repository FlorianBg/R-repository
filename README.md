The effect of drought events on water expanse of the river Main at Mainschleife Volkach
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Amongst the many of the effects of the climate change are drought events and dry summer months. 
This also affects the region of Lower Franconia and respectively the river system of the Main. 
The summer of 2018 was very dry with uncommonly low water levels. 
Especially the Mainschleife near the city of Volkach is subjected to variation and extremes of its water levels 
because it is separated by a lock and used as compensation area for keeping water depths leveled in a nearby shipping canal. 
The variations in vertical water levels also lead to a varying lateral extent of the river surface 
which is represented in earth observation data. The main objective of this study is, 
to compare remote sensing data for two timesteps with a medium/average and a low water level in the river arm of the Mainschleife near Volkach. 
Based on water level values, measured near the north end of the study area satellite data from Sentinel 2 are selected, 
representing the maximum and minimum visible water level without cloud cover over the Mainschleife. 
The scenes are classified to derive the maximum and minimum extent of the water surface in the year 2018. 
The maximum values will be referred to as a flood-events, because they are the few largest peaks in the considered measurements. 
Respectively the minimum water levels are referred to as drought events, 
because they occur in the summer months and are accompanied by generally low NDVI values in the study area. 

The Mainschleife near Volkach is the largest meandering stream landscape in Bavaria and forms a part of the Main-triangle. 
It is located roughly 20km east of WÃ¼rzburg in lower Franconia and displays the typical morphology of a meandering stream.
The river is at least 25m wide, on average around 40m. At the northern end of the study area the Main branches off to the east
into a shipping canal and westwards into the Mainschleife. It flows southwards and is separated from the canal by a barrier 
which is mainly used for electricity production and keeping water depths leveled for vessels. 
This amplifies variation of the water depth within the Mainschleife as it is used for compensation. 
At the southern end there is another barrier where the river arms reunite. The canal was created to shortcut the meandering river arm.
